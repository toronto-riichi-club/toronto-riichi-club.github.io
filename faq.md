### How many people usually attend the meetups?

Meetup sizes usually range from 4 to 32 people.

Many meetups have a player cap (due to the seating capacity of the establishment), so please make sure you RSVP to the event to reserve your spot.

### How do I RSVP for an event?

Under the Events tab on Discord (at the top of the channels list), you will find a list of upcoming events.
To RSVP, click the "Interested" button.

### The event has hit the player cap. Is there a waiting list?

There is! If the event has hit the player cap, you can join the waiting list by pressing the interested button and letting us know in the appropriate region channel.

### Do I need to bring anything to a meetup?

For most meetups, sets are provided by the members.
Before meetups occur, there is usually a poll to see who is able to bring a set.
If you have indicated in the poll that you are able to bring a set, please bring the set to the meetup.

### Do I have to pay to attend a meetup? How?

Most in-person meetups are hosted at board game cafes that have seating fees. This seating fee varies by location. This seating fee is paid directly to the establishment. Payment is made either when you enter or before you leave, depending on the establishment.

### I can't attend the full meetup. Can I leave early? Can I arrive late?

For most meetups, you can leave early, but please do so after you have finished your game.

As for arriving late, this will depend on the event. If an event has hit the player cap, arriving late is typically frowned upon.

In either case, please let the event organizer know beforehand.

## Beginners

### I'm new to riichi or have never played in-person before. Can I still attend the regular meetups?

You sure can! We accept players of all skill levels, from complete beginners to seasoned veterans. We'll teach you need to know and show you the ropes on how to play in person.

We also host novice sessions on occasion. Keep an eye on the [Discord Server][Discord] for when the next session will take place.

### I don't know how to score my hands, is that okay?

~~Nobody actually knows how to score and we just make up numbers as we go along.~~

That's fine. There is usually someone at the table who can score. If not, you can ask someone who is not playing (such as a free staff member).
You can also use an app to help you score, like the [Riichi Calc - Japanese Mahjong](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ric.ov.RiichiCalc) app for Android.

### What etiquette do I have to have?

We expect all players to respect and be nice to each other.

Most of the basic etiquette can be found in our [tournament etiquette guide][tournament etiquette]. However, some of these rules may be more relaxed in a casual or regular meetup setting (like talking during the game)

In addition, please make sure to follow any rules put in place by the venue. We are guests at their business.

### I have a friend who wants to learn how to play. Can I bring them?

Sure! It is preferred if they join the Discord server to mark themselves as interested, but you can also reserve a spot for them by letting the organizer know in the appropriate region channel in the [Discord server][Discord].

## Mahjong Products

### Where can I buy a Japanese mahjong set and mat?

For those interested in purchasing a new mahjong set, it is recommended to also purchase a mat to reduce noise and damage to the tiles.

The standard for high-quality mahjong sets is the AMOS series or mahjong sets (available on [Amazon Japan](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/stores/page/D818D2ED-18D6-4915-8DBA-1965A3EBA4C0)). For those on a budget, Yellow Mountain Imports (YMI) is an acceptable substitute (available on [Amazon Canada](https://www.amazon.ca/Yellow-Mountain-Imports-Japanese-Mah-Jongg/dp/B003UU129U/)).

For mats, the Junk Mat is the way to go (available on [Amazon Canada](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0017KHW3A/) and [Amazon Japan](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B096K7SL6R)).

The [AMOS Prime Gear](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B09MLZX8TY) is a mahjong set + Junk Mat combo is the cheapest option if you want both.
However, the storage system for the mahjong set (which is connected to the Junk Mat) can be unreliable at times.

If you want a more reliable way to store your tiles, you can purchase the set and mat separately. Most standalone sets have a case.

On occasion, the club will organize a group order in order to reduce shipping costs. Keep an eye out in the #announcements channel in the [Discord server][Discord] for the next one.

The [Mahjong Product Selection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1u5MFDZ3NPIu9zMKaMlEK3RAh917qaGiU9aybyoPtGUY/edit) spreadsheet has a comparison of AMOS products (prices may vary).

### Where can I play on an automatic table (autotable)?

Downtown Toronto meetups at 17 Tiles are played on Chinese autotables. 

Some members of the club also own autotables. Make friends with them and you just might be invited to their next pickup game. 

### How can I buy a Japanese autotable? 

Alban is a company in Japan that sells autotables, notably the [Slim+](https://www.alban.co.jp/user_data/slim_plus_28s_and_33s) and the [SlimScore](https://www.alban.co.jp/user_data/slim_SCORE28S_and_33S). You can send them an email in English and they will help you coordinate your order. However, you will have to choose your own proxy service to get it shipped to Canada. Because it is coming from Japan the cost of shipping will be very expensive. 

[Mahjong Stars](https://www.mjstars.net/) in the United States sells autotables created by AMOS. However, due to [Ontario electrical laws](https://esasafe.com/electrical-products/product-approval-exceptions/), they are "not legal" to use in Ontario.
